In this study, we propose a joint competing risk model with discrete time to analyze the duration of students’ enrollment in the Bachelor’s degree in Statistics at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), considering two competing risks: graduation or dropout. The model also jointly analyzes the longitudinally measured standardized GPA. The dataset includes records from all students enrolled between 2012 and 2017, with a maximum observation time of 12 semesters, treating those exceeding this time as right-censored. Data were obtained from demographic questionnaires, entrance exam scores, and academic records. A joint model with a competing risk model and a mixed linear model was developed. Two fitting approaches were used: a two-stage model with random effects estimated from longitudinal data in the first stage and a bivariate model with shared random effects, estimating all effects simultaneously from the joint distribution. Model fit was assessed using deviance statistics and residuals analysis. The results show that standardized GPA significantly affects enrollment duration, and the bivariate model provided a better fit than the two-stage model.
